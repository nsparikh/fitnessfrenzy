=============

FitnessFrenzy is an application that lets users monitor their personal growth and compete with friends who share similar fitness goals. Our site allows you to create customized trackers for absolutely anything (unlike other services that only let you choose from a preselected set of tracking metrics). With FitnessFrenzy, you can monitor your progress and that of your competitors using our intuitive and insightful dynamic visualizations.

Site is hosted on Heroku: http://fitnessfrenzy.herokuapp.com/
For judging: We have created and populated a user account with some trackers and challenges for you to play around with. The login name is "test@example.com" with the password "password1".

All source code is located within the "fitness" directory.
