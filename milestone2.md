# Milestone 2

Site is hosted on Heroku: http://fitnessfrenzy.herokuapp.com/

1) No.
2) Personal dashboard page is pretty much complete. This contains individualized trackers and allows users to create and visualize custom trackers. You can play around with it by logging in with the email address "test@example.com" and password "password1", or create your own user account.
3) We want to make the visualizations more effective by adding some kind of progress bar indicating how close the user is to reaching a goal for any given tracker.
4) We are in the process of creating the Challenges framework, which will allow users to create competition groups with their friends and visualize each other's progress as the challenge progreses. We already have a mechanism in place for creating new challenges, but we need to add in a way of adding other users to a challenge and also the visualization template for the page. We do not anticipate that this will be very difficult because we can build it on top of the already complete Tracker framework. Additionally, the site's styling is not in its final form.
5) Ruby on Rails
6) Mostly Javascript and JQuery; also using visualization package d3.js
7) Google Chrome
8) We're tyring to make our visualizations as awesome as possible, so any feedback is appreciated!
